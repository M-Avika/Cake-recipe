4. 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, (or bi-carb soda)
5. 1 teaspoon salt
6. 2 cups white granulated sugar, (14 oz | 410 g)
7. 2 large eggs

10. 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
11. 1 cup boiling water (250 ml)


TIPS: 
Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl first to get rid of any hard lumps caused during storage, while getting more air into the mixture.
Then add in your wet ingredients. Just keep in mind that the cake batter is VERY thin. Don’t be tempted to add more flour as this is what makes the cake super soft and moist.
This chocolate cake only needs about 30-35 minutes in the oven, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

Make sure you preheat your oven before starting. We’ve included temperatures for standard AND fan or convention ovens.
If using springform pans, note that they are NOT 100% leakproof. Very thin cake batters such as this one will leak through the base. To combat this issue, line the base with parchment paper coming up where the sides meets the base to create a ‘cover’. Place a baking sheet on the shelf below the cake pan (or the bottom of the oven) to catch any stray drips. Don’t put cake pans directly on the pan as the heat will effect the base of your cakes.
Let cake cool COMPLETELY.

YOUR CAKE IS DONE!
